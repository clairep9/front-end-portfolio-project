Welcome to MOVIEFANS! This is a web application for movie enthusiasts to discover and explore a world of movies. The theme for this project is red, white, black, grey and gold to complement the cinemas' aesthetic. This application displays popular movies and now playing movies using the TMDB api. 
The project is split into multiple files, with each file relating to a specific functionality.There is a home section, where we welcome you to our application. There is a search bar where you can search any movie and it will display the results based on your input. If a movie doesnt have an image, a default no-image picture will be displayed instead. 
The header and footer are consistent throughout each page. When you hover on the links in the header, their color changes to white. When you hover on the links in the footer, their color changes to gold. While the header links take you to their respective pages, the footer links are just for visual purposes. 
When you search for a movie in the home page, popular page and now playing pages, it directs you to the search.html. However, you need to search up the movie one more time to get any result. 
If you click on the search button, yet the value in the input bar is empty, the default behavior of the click event (displaying movies) is prevented.
